# Who am I

I am from Barcelona.
I study Business and Law at ESADE Business School.
I've never coded anything other than the prework and for the Cabify Scholarship.

# Why am I here

I've always been interested in coding and data analytics can be easily applied in finance, the area i'd like to work.
I expect to work on my interpersonal skills, to develop coding skills and to work on my "resistance" while working hard.

# What will I do after the bootcamp?

Finance or Business analysis.
I'll keep studying, but I'd love to find a part-time job that fits my university schedule.
To optimize processes in order to reduce resources for a better world.
